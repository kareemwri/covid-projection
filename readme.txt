This file was made using a file called worldwide.csv
The worldwide.csv file was created by aggregating information found from CSSI.
Their github page with the original files are located https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.
The 3 files were summed by day, added to a new csv file, and transposed such that 3 new columns would be formed.
The 4 column was created by taking the difference between the confirmed from the sum of deaths and recovered.
All else was done in jypter notebook as can be seen in the ipynb file.
